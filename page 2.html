            <td width =450px> <p>It was in 2008. I was only 9 years old at that time. The first match I watched was Liverpool FC vs Inter Milan FC. The English club Liverpool won that match and I started supporting Liverpool. My favorite player during those times was the club's captain, Steven Gerrard. His goals were always magnificent and they excited me. It was from 2007 to 2010 before I changed to support a German club named Bayern Munich. </p> </td>
            <td width =450px><p>In 2009, many players of Liverpool started to get old. They didn't play as well as they had played. Because of financial problems, the club started to sell their key players. That was where Liverpool started to fall. They seemed to be inferior to their rival which was Manchester United. I really hated Manchester United and I still hate them at the moment. Then there was a match between Manchester United and Bayern Munich in the European Championship. Arjen Robben, the most prominent player of that German at that time scored a volley to defeat the club that I hated. That was when I started to support Bayern and my favorite player is no one other than Robben. </p> </td>
            <td width =450px><p>This have been already the seventh years I have been a big fan for this club. They have already achieved all the possible trophies that a club could have and they still planned to win those trophies more times. Soccer and especially this club have given me a lot of feelings. Bitterness from defeat, explosive happiness when the team became the champion, I have experienced them all.  </p> </td>
