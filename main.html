            <td width=800px>My parents are both doctors. When I was a child, I used to live with my father and my grandmother because my mother went to college after she gave birth to me. My father is also busy with his work. They rarely had time with me. Therefore, it could be said that I and my parents did not have a super strong relationship. However, we are still members of a family. We respect and love each other. I will do anything to make them happy.</td>
            <td width=800px>My name is Binh. I was born in Vietnam. I have just moved to America since last August. I'm not even a US citizen. I just come here to study. When Visa expire, I have to go back to my country. I like video games, soccer and superhero movies, which will be explained further in the following pages. My favorite subject is Math. To be honest, Math is the only subject I think I can do well.  </td>
            <td width=800px>My sister and me used to have rivalry relationship. I've never liked children. They're too annoying to get along with. When she was 3 or 4, she always disturbed me so that I often yelled at her which made her cry and obviously my parents would see it as my fault. Fortunately, she's grown up now. I don't know if being in 4th grade could be considered to be "grown up" but at least she doesn't distract me from doing my stuff anymore </td>
