            <td width=450px>Jason Voorhees is my favorite character in this game. To be honest, he is the only reason I play this game. I'm a fan of the 80's and 90's slasher horror movies and Jason is the most iconic character in those films.</td>
            <td width=450px> Michael Myers is another iconic slasher that I like. This is just another video game which I play because there's a character I like in it.</td>
            <td width=450px>There is obvioulsy no killer in this game (LOL!!). But it's still a favorite video game of mine. It's a game of soccer, which is my favorite sports. The gameplay and graphics are so extremely realistic that I have a feeling I'm coaching all the big teams in the world while playing this game</td>
